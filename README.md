Enterprise Cloud-Native Microservices Platform on AWS EKS

> A production-grade, secure, and scalable cloud-native platform built on AWS EKS using GitOps, DevSecOps, Service Mesh, and Event-Driven Architecture principles.




---

🚀 Project Overview

Travelersources.com is a fully containerized microservices platform designed to simulate a real-world, enterprise-level travel commerce system.

It demonstrates:

Secure AWS cloud architecture

Kubernetes-native design

GitOps-based deployments

Progressive delivery strategies

Observability & runtime security

Multi-environment & disaster recovery architecture

Event-driven microservices with Kafka & CDC


This project reflects production-ready DevOps & Cloud Engineering practices.

🏗 Architecture Overview

☁️ Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)

Amazon EKS (Kubernetes cluster)

EC2 worker nodes

VPC & networking isolation

Route53 DNS management

KMS encryption

EBS CSI driver with encrypted volumes

Multi-AZ architecture

Multi-environment (dev / prod)

Disaster Recovery-ready design


Infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform & Terragrunt.


---

⚙️ Kubernetes Platform

Core Components

ArgoCD (GitOps continuous delivery)

Argo Rollouts (Canary & Blue/Green deployments)

Istio Service Mesh (mTLS, traffic control)

Karpenter (dynamic autoscaling)

ExternalDNS

Cert-Manager (TLS automation)



---

🔐 DevSecOps & Security

Security is implemented at multiple layers:

Kyverno policies (image policies, resource enforcement)

Pod Security Admission (PSA)

Falco runtime threat detection

RBAC governance

Sealed Secrets

External Secrets Operator (ESO)

Encrypted EBS volumes (KMS-backed)

mTLS enforced via Istio


This ensures compliance, workload isolation, and runtime security visibility.


---

🔄 CI/CD & GitOps

CI/CD

Multi-repository GitHub Actions

Multi-environment pipelines (dev / staging / prod)

Image build & push automation

Deployment validation workflows


GitOps

ArgoCD application management

Helm-based base templates

Kustomize overlays per environment

Progressive delivery via Argo Rollouts


Deployment strategy supports:

Canary releases

Blue/Green deployments

Automated rollback



---

📊 Observability & Monitoring

Full observability stack includes:

Prometheus

Alertmanager

Grafana dashboards

Slack-integrated alerts

PodMonitors & ServiceMonitors

OpenTelemetry metrics

K6 load testing

Istio telemetry


This ensures high availability, performance visibility, and rapid incident response.


---

📦 Microservices Architecture

The application consists of independent services:

Auth Service

Catalog Service

Cart Service

Orders Service

Payments Service

Frontend (React + Vite)


Each service:

Is containerized (Docker)

Exposes Prometheus metrics

Follows clean microservice boundaries

Communicates asynchronously via Kafka when required



---

🔁 Event-Driven & Data Layer

The platform uses:

Kafka for messaging

Debezium for Change Data Capture (CDC)

PostgreSQL for persistent storage

Redis for caching

Kafka UI for observability


This enables:

Event streaming

Service decoupling

Data replication strategies

Real-time updates



---

💾 Backup & Disaster Recovery

Kasten K10 backup strategies

Multi-region-ready design

Kafka CDC replication support

Encrypted persistent volumes

Environment isolation


The architecture is designed for resilience and high availability.


---

🧪 Local Development Environment

A Minikube-based local Kubernetes setup replicates:

Microservices

Monitoring stack

Policies

Rollouts

Security rules


This ensures parity between local and cloud environments.
